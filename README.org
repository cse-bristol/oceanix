A small program to do nix deployments & provisioning into digitalocean.

This has a small subset of the features in nixops.

Unlike nixops, all state is inferred from digitalocean.

A deployment is done into a digitalocean tag; machines within a deployment have to have a unique name, and so these can be mapped to DO machine names.
